# Rain World (downpour)

Enable dxvk in bottle settings to fix freezing and blackscreens when the intro cutscene for each slugcat is being played.
After each cutscene has been played and you have slept in a shelter for the first time (saved your game), you can disable dxvk.
 

Out of the box the game will report that your mods do not have a configuration menu.
 
To fix this: 

1. Open your bottle with rain world
2. click on bottle configuration
3. click on wine configuration
4. Now click "add application" 
  (if you only have rain world installed in that bottle then skip this)
5. Now navigate to the rainworld exe file, click on it and click open
6. Now navigate to "Libraries" and click on the drop down menu next to "new override for libraries" and select "winhttp" and add it
7. click apply 

Your mods should now work.
> [!Note]
> If your mods still won't work try changing the windows version in wine configaration to "windows 7"
